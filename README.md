-requires windows>=7;
-Just demo, donâ€™t have too high expectations, the current success rate is not high, please wait patiently;
-The default stage.bin of PS4 11.00 is used. If you use 9.00, you need to overwrite the two bin files yourself;
-If pppwn.py is updated later, there is no need to update the exe, and it will directly overwrite "pppwn.py", "offsets.py" and the two stage.bins;

1. Open the "Install the environment first!" folder and install the three items inside
2. Connect PS4 and PC using a network cable, enter PS4 Settings-Network-Set Internet Connection-Use Lan-Customize-PPPOE, and fill in a name and password.
3. Run "PPPwnGo.exe", select the PS4 version and the corresponding network card, generally the default is fine (unless you have multiple network cards), click the "Go" button
4. Click to enter "Test Internet" in the PS4 network
5. When the execution is completed, "done" will be displayed, and "PPPwn" will pop up in the upper left corner of PS4. If it is stuck, fails, crashes or loses power, repeat 3&4

Special thanks Andy for his efforts!
